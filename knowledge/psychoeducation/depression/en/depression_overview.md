## What is depression?
Depression is more than sadness. It can affect sleep, appetite, energy, and interest in activities. It is common and treatable.

## Common signs
- Low mood most days; loss of interest/pleasure
- Changes in sleep (too little/too much)
- Appetite or weight changes, fatigue
- Feelings of worthlessness or guilt
- Difficulty concentrating

## What helps (today)
- One small activity you used to enjoy (music, sunlight, brief walk)
- Text or call someone you trust
- 2 minutes of box breathing or grounding
- Eat and hydrate regularly; set gentle routines

## Building support
- Break tasks into tiny steps; celebrate completion
- Keep a simple morning and evening routine
- Movement (even brief) helps mood over time
- Consider counseling; treatment helps

## When to seek more support
- Symptoms most days for 2+ weeks
- Thoughts of self-harm or not wanting to live
- Unable to manage daily tasks

## If you’re in crisis
In Tanzania, call 116 or go to the nearest hospital if you feel unsafe.
