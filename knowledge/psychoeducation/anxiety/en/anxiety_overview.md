Source notes: Adapted from public-domain and permissive health education materials (e.g., CDC/NIH/NHS). Localized for Tanzania context. This is supportive information, not a diagnosis.

## What is anxiety?
Anxiety is a normal human response to threat or uncertainty. When it becomes persistent or overwhelming, it can affect sleep, concentration, and daily life.

## Common signs
- Feeling nervous, on edge, or restless
- Racing thoughts, difficulty concentrating
- Rapid heart rate, shortness of breath, sweating
- Trouble sleeping, fatigue

## What helps (today)
- 2 minutes of box breathing (4‑4‑4‑4)
- Grounding (5‑4‑3‑2‑1) to refocus on the present
- Write down the specific worry and a small next step
- Limit caffeine later in the day; drink water

## Building resilience
- Consistent sleep/wake times and screen‑free wind‑down
- Gentle movement (walk, stretch) most days
- Problem‑solving in small steps; ask for support
- Practice self‑compassion; anxiety is manageable

## When to seek more support
- Anxiety most days for weeks
- Panic attacks or avoidance that limits your routine
- Using alcohol/substances to cope more often
- Work, school, or relationships are significantly affected

## If you’re in crisis
In Tanzania, call 116 or go to the nearest hospital if you feel unsafe. Your safety comes first.
