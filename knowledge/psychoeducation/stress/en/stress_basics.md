# Stress: Understanding and Coping

Source notes: Adapted from public-domain and permissive health education materials (e.g., CDC/NIH/NHS). Localized for Tanzania context. This is supportive information, not a diagnosis.

## What is stress?
Stress is the body’s response to pressure or change. Short bursts can help you act, but long-lasting stress can affect sleep, mood, and health.

## Common signs
- Feeling overwhelmed or irritable
- Muscle tension, headaches, stomach discomfort
- Trouble sleeping, fatigue
- Difficulty concentrating

## What helps (today)
- 2 minutes of box breathing (4-4-4-4)
- Short walk, water, light snack if hungry
- One small step on a task; write it down and complete it
- Limit news/social media for a set period

## Routines that support you
- Regular sleep/wake times, screen-free wind‑down
- Balanced meals, hydration
- Brief daily movement (walk, stretch)
- Connect with someone you trust

## When to seek more support
- Stress feels unmanageable most days
- Sleep and mood continue to worsen
- You’re using alcohol or substances to cope more often
- Work, study, or relationships are significantly affected

## If you’re in crisis
In Tanzania, call 116 or go to the nearest hospital if you feel unsafe. Your safety comes first.

## Local context and next steps
- Try a grounding exercise (5‑4‑3‑2‑1) or breathing support
- Consider speaking to a counselor (confidential). If you prefer chat: WhatsApp link provided in the app
