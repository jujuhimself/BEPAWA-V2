# HIV Stigma: Understanding and Support

Source notes: Adapted from public-domain and permissive health education materials (e.g., CDC/UNICEF/WHO licensing as applicable). Localized for Tanzania context. This is supportive information, not a diagnosis.

## What is stigma?
Stigma is unfair negative attitudes or treatment toward people living with HIV. It can cause isolation, stress, and barriers to care. Stigma is harmful and can be reduced.

## Common experiences
- Worry about disclosure and discrimination
- Internalized shame or self‑blame
- Avoiding care or medication pickups due to fear
- Social withdrawal

## What helps (today)
- Talk to a trusted person or peer support group
- Plan disclosure at your own pace and comfort
- Remind yourself: HIV is a health condition; you deserve respect and care
- Breathe/ground when anxiety rises during social situations

## Practical steps
- Know your rights and local protections
- Use private channels for care coordination (e.g., confidential WhatsApp/chat)
- Create a disclosure plan (who, when, what to say) only if you want to disclose

## When to seek more support
- Ongoing fear prevents you from getting care or taking meds
- Severe stress, anxiety, or depressive symptoms
- Experiences of discrimination or violence

## If you’re in crisis
In Tanzania, call 116 or go to the nearest hospital if you feel unsafe.

## Local context and next steps
- Ask for counselor support; confidential chat is available in the app
- Explore coping tools for stress and anxiety
- Link to local resources and peer groups where available
